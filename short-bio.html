        <h2 class="title">Hi, I'm Iswarya Vasudevan </h2>
        <p>A Full Stack Developer is someone who works with the Back End — or server side — of the application as well as the Front End, or client side. Full Stack Developers have to have some skills in a wide variety of coding niches, from databases to graphic design and UI/UX management in order to do their job well. We are something of a swing, ready to assist wherever needed in the process.</p>
        <p>For instance, a small independent game group made up of only a few people creating a small simulator could have one Back End Developer and one Front End Developer and that might be all needed for the development. If they’re even smaller, they might have one Full Stack Developer who handles the entire application. On the other hand, a large web application with strong potential for scaling will require many hands on deck — Back End, Front End, and Full Stack Developers.</p>
