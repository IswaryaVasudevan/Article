        <p class="meta">Iswarya Vasudevan ~ 14th April 2011</p>
        <p>This is not just an article of the sort but a fantastic resource on what it takes to become a Web developer. It lists all the technologies and tools a Web developer should be familiar with.
          I really liked those mind-maps which appear now in many other places on the web. It effectively complements The Web Developer Bootcamp course, which teaches you most of the technologies mentioned in this roadmap.
